4.Used Encoding - encodeWithSignature

Explaination

1.Purpose - With the help of low level function call we have created this smart contract with much more felxibilty, this program accepts the data and tranfer the data into other contract with more ease as it uses encoding encodeWithSignature protocol.

2.Detail Usage - This function take the values and returns boolean accordingly if the transaction was successful or not,this function uses encoding - encodeWithSignature and uses low level call, this method is used because it is more efficint as the encoding - encodewithsignautre, doesn't uses padding and also it is storage efficient.

3.Impact - Bounty function makes the contract efficient, fast, it also makes the source code look more readable and easy to understand, it contibute the smart contact by using encodewithsignaure protocol, in which padding is not used which makes it more efficient as compared to other calls.
